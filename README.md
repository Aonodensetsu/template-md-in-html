A simple PHP index file to write markdown on the web.

You want some text in the browser, without dealing with HTML/CSS/JS?  
This is it.

You want OpenGraph magic?  
This has it.

You want to sprinkle in some HTML \<details\> inline into that markdown?  
This works with that.

This makes every text website you can think of like you were typing in an editor, or (decent) chat app.

If you're using CORS, just add cdn.jsdelivr.net and the one inline style (hash in a comment) to allowed origins, and it'll work perfectly fine.
